# While-tool
A small Haskell tool, to parse, execute and make fancy outpt for the simple "while"-language. It was an excercise for FLP2013

For now, you'll find some examples of the "while"-language. Once enough people sent in their solutions for the project of Haskell-lessenreeks, my code will be published here.
